Hello there, my name is Michael Cai.   
I am an undergraduate attending CUNY Queens College pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science.   
Currently I have a GPA of 3.97 and a expected graduation date of June 2022.  

```markdown
Courses I have completed include: 
- Object-Oriented Programming in Java and in C++  
- Software Engineering  
- Data Structures 
- Theory of Computation  
- Functional Programming  
- Design & Analysis of Algorithms   
- Database Fundamentals  
- Data Analytics  
- Internet & Web Technologies    
- Numerical Methods  
- Computaitonal Finance  
```

Outside of academic marks, I enjoy working with peers and being a team player. My efforts to use clear communication and organization of assigning tasks had led to much success in leadership. In high school, I have been elected as the head of engineer for the robotics team for my ability to explain mechanical concepts and delegate tasks effectively. In college I led multiple group projects and recieved acknowledgement from both my peers and professors for teamwork. 

I also worked as a tutor at the Academic Support Center at Queens College for the database course.

Currently, I am looking into studying data science and cybersecurity as potential career options.
