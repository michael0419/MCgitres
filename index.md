Outside of academic marks, I enjoy working with peers and being a team player. My efforts to use clear communication and organization of assigning tasks had led to much success in leadership. In high school, I have been elected as the head of engineer for the robotics team for my ability to explain mechanical concepts and delegate tasks effectively. In college I led multiple group projects and recieved acknowledgement from both my peers and professors for teamwork. 
  
I also worked as a tutor at the Academic Support Center at Queens College for the database course after being recommended by my database professor from my teamwork tutoring.
